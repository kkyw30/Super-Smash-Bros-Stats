# Super-Smash-Bros-Stats
This project calculates a variety of Smash Bros performance metrics for commonly played characters based on a vast collection of data. Performance metrics including win percentage, win probabilities, and kill efficiencies are calculated for each character (and corresponding data) listed in an Excel file. This project makes extensive use of pandas, numpy, matplotlib, pyxll, and the statistics libraries to extract data from Excel files and perform significant statistical analyses. The conclusions drawn from these data analyses are also included.
